# sentiment-classification
Project uses K Nearest Neighbor Classifier to classify movie review sentiment

Overview and Assignment Goals:

The objectives of this assignment are the following:
• Implement the Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm
• Handle Text Data (Reviews of movies)
• Design and Engineer Features from Text Data.
• Choose the Best Model, i.e., Parameters of a Nearest Neighbor Selection, Features
and Similarity Functions

Detailed Description:

For this assignment, your task is to infer sentiment (or polarity) from free-form review
text submitted for movies.
For the purposes of this assignment you have to implement a k-Nearest Neighbor 
Classifier to predict the sentiment for 25000 reviews for movies provided in the test file
(test.dat). 
Positive sentiment is represented by a +1 review rating, and Negative
Sentiment is represented by a review rating of -1. 
In test.dat you are only provided the reviews but no ground truth rating, which will be 
used to compare with your predictions.
Training data consists of 25000 reviews as well and exists in file train.dat. Each row
begins with the sentiment score followed with a text of the rating.
For both training and test data, each review ends with #EOF to denote the end of review.


Report file is a 2-Page, single-spaced report
describing details regarding the steps you followed for developing the
classifier for predicting the product review sentiments. It includes
the following:

§ My Approach

§ Methodology of choosing the approach and associated
parameters.

§ Describe how the metric Accuracy is computed. In which
application will Accuracy be an unsuitable metric?

§ Efficiency of your algorithm in terms of run time. Did you do
anything to improve the run time (e.g. dimensionality reduction)?
If so, describe them and report run times with their respective
accuracy before and after the improvement.
